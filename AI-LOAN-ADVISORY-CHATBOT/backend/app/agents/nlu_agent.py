NLU Agent — Phase 2
Uses Gemini to detect user intent and extract financial entities from
natural language. Falls back to regex pattern matching if Gemini is
unavailable or rate-limited.

Gemini is ONLY used for:
  1. Intent classification
  2. Entity extraction
  3. Answering general loan knowledge questions

Gemini is NEVER used for financial calculations.

_INTENT_PROMPT = """You are a JSON-only intent parser for an Indian loan advisory chatbot.

Analyse the user message and extract entities.

INTENTS:
- eligibility_check: Asking about approval chances or status (e.g., "Can I get a loan?", "Will I qualify for 5 lakhs?")
- emi_calculation: Asking for monthly payment calculations (e.g., "What is the EMI for 2 lakhs over 2 years at 10%?")
- max_loan_query: Asking for borrowing limit (e.g., "What is the maximum loan I can get with 50k income?")
- dti_query: Asking about debt-to-income ratio (e.g., "How does my EMI affect my eligibility?", "What is my DTI?")
- rejection_reason: Asking why a loan was denied or how to improve (e.g., "Why was my loan rejected?", "How to boost my score?")
- general_question: Any other loan-related topics (e.g., "What documents are required?", "Is Aadhaar mandatory?")

EXTRACTION RULES:
- Convert amounts: "5 lakh" -> 500000, "1 crore" -> 10000000.
- Convert time: "5 years" -> 60 months, "2 years" -> 24 months.
- Interest rate: Extract as float (e.g., "10%" -> 10.0).
- Entity Assignment:
    - monthly_income: Only user earnings.
    - existing_emi: Only current debt obligations.
    - loan_amount: Only the principal being requested.
    - If entity is not present, use null.
- DISAMBIGUATION: If the user says "I earn 50k and pay 10k EMI", 50k is monthly_income and 10k is existing_emi. Do not put them in loan_amount.

User message: "{message}"

Respond with ONLY valid JSON:
